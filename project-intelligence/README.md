# Project Intelligence

**Surface patterns in any team's work — code, documents, designs, or compliance artifacts.**

A composable skill set that analyzes project data across disciplines and surfaces factual, data-driven observations for retrospectives, quality gates, release decisions, and process improvement.

> **A note on terminology:** These skills use the word **"story"** to mean any trackable unit of work — whether your team calls them stories, tasks, tickets, cards, work items, or issues. If it moves through columns on a board or has a lifecycle status, it's a story here.

---

## What This Does

**For Retrospectives:**
Generate comparative observations about cycle time, throughput, blockers, and team patterns — formatted for import into Miro, Mural, or Jira boards.

**For Quality Gates:**
Summarize check results for any deliverable — CI builds, document reviews, design critiques, compliance audits — and recommend a clear action: proceed, block, retry, or escalate.

**For Flow Diagnosis:**
Identify why stories, tickets, or tasks are stalled. Distinguish blockers from unclear specs, split needs, and external dependencies.

**For Release Decisions:**
Aggregate signals across quality checks, open risks, schedule status, and team readiness to inform go/no-go decisions.

## Quick Start

### Manual Input (No Setup Required)

```
Analyze sprint 14 for our retrospective.

Sprint 14 stories:
- DEV-88: "API rate limiting" — 28hr cycle time
- DES-34: "Redesign onboarding flow" — 52hr cycle time
- LEGAL-12: "Update privacy policy for EU launch" — 44hr cycle time
- MKT-67: "Write Q2 campaign brief" — 18hr cycle time

8 stories completed, avg cycle time 31hr
7 blockers (3 on LEGAL-12 — external counsel delays)
Previous 3 sprints averaged 36hr cycle time and 10 stories completed.
Team norms: cycle time <48hr, WIP limit 5
```

### Automated (With Connectors)

```
Analyze sprint 14. Fetch from ~~project tracker and ~~code repository.
```

## Design Principles

1. **Multidisciplinary** — Same patterns work for code, documents, designs, and compliance artifacts
2. **Modularity** — Input skills are independent building blocks; use standalone or combine via aggregators
3. **Graceful Degradation** — Works with full automation, partial automation, or manual input
4. **Factual Voice** — No opinions. Observations start with `[DATA]` and include baseline comparisons
5. **Tool Agnostic** — Uses `~~` connector placeholders. Adapts to whatever tools your team runs
6. **Canonical Sources** — Checks against configured reference documents, not arbitrary search results

## Example Output

```markdown
# Sprint Retrospective Input | Sprint 14

**Sources:** manual input
**Baseline:** Sprints 11-13

---

### Cycle Time Improvement — success
[DATA] Avg cycle time decreased 14% to 31hr (vs 36hr baseline). Within <48hr norm.

### Throughput Drop — risk
[DATA] 8 stories completed (-20% vs 10-story baseline).

### Blocker Spike — improvement
[DATA] 7 blockers (+133% vs 3 baseline). 3 of 7 concentrated on LEGAL-12 (external counsel delays).
