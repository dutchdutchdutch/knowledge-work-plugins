# Project Intelligence

**Surface patterns in any team's work e.g. code, documents, designs, or compliance artifacts.**

A composable skill set that analyzes project data across disciplines.  It surfaces factual, data-driven observations for retrospectives, quality gates, release decisions, and process improvement. Designed to supplement role-specific plugins.

> **A note on terminology:** These skills use the word **"story"** to mean any trackable unit of work — whether your team calls them stories, tasks, tickets, cards, work items, or issues. If it moves through columns on a board or has a lifecycle status, it's a story here.

## Where This Fits

The Anthropic plugin suite is **role-based**; each plugin coaches a specific role (product manager, legal counsel, finance) and performs tasks on their behalf. Project-intelligence is **process-based**; it observes what's happening across all roles and answers: *"What's the actual state of this project right now?"*

| | Role Plugins | Project Intelligence |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | "Do this job. Help me do task X" | "What's actually happening?" |
| **Approach** | Frameworks, templates, best practices | Pattern detection, anomaly surfacing |
| **Scope** | Single role | Cross-functional |
| **Output** | Job artifacts, coaching & structure | Observations and signals |

### Value by Skill

| Skill | Unique Contribution | Relationship to Role Plugins |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| `release-readiness` | Cross-skill synthesis into a single go/no-go | No role plugin aggregates across disciplines |
| `sprint-retro-input` | Comparative retro analysis with evidence | No role plugin does data-driven retrospectives |
| `activity-audit` | "Is the status real?" verification | No role plugin audits reported vs. actual status |
| `dependency-readiness` | Staleness-first dependency checks | No role plugin checks if dependencies are *current* |
| `stakeholder-signoff` | Enablement verification + rubber stamp detection | `stakeholder-comms` teaches *how to communicate*; this checks *if communication was effective* |
| `story-flow` | "Why is this stuck?" diagnosis | `roadmap-management` covers flow implicitly; this diagnoses root causes |
| `change-summary` | Review delta (feedback loop closure) | Role plugins generate release notes; this tracks *what changed since your last review* |
| `risk-tracker` | Cascade + accumulation pattern detection | `legal-risk-assessment` uses severity/likelihood scoring; this detects emerging patterns |
| `quality-check` | Domain-agnostic gate checking | Role plugins have domain-specific quality; this provides a universal gate framework |
| `schedule-forecast` | Quantitative completion forecasting | `roadmap-management` is strategic; this is mathematical |

## What This Does

**For Retrospectives:**
Generate comparative observations about cycle time, throughput, blockers, and team patterns — formatted for import into Miro, Mural, or Jira boards.

**For Quality Gates:**
Summarize check results for any deliverable — CI builds, document reviews, design critiques, compliance audits — and recommend a clear action: proceed, block, retry, or escalate.

**For Flow Diagnosis:**
Identify why stories, tickets, or tasks are stalled. Distinguish blockers from unclear specs, split needs, and external dependencies.

**For Release Decisions:**
Aggregate signals across quality checks, open risks, schedule status, and team readiness to inform go/no-go decisions.

## Quick Start

### Manual Input (No Setup Required)

```
Analyze sprint 14 for our retrospective.

Sprint 14 stories:
- DEV-88: "API rate limiting" — 28hr cycle time
- DES-34: "Redesign onboarding flow" — 52hr cycle time
- LEGAL-12: "Update privacy policy for EU launch" — 44hr cycle time
- MKT-67: "Write Q2 campaign brief" — 18hr cycle time

8 stories completed, avg cycle time 31hr
7 blockers (3 on LEGAL-12 — external counsel delays)
Previous 3 sprints averaged 36hr cycle time and 10 stories completed.
Team norms: cycle time <48hr, WIP limit 5
```

### Automated (With Connectors)

```
Analyze sprint 14. Fetch from ~~project tracker and ~~code repository.
```

See [CONNECTORS.md](./CONNECTORS.md) for tool setup.

## Design Principles

1. **Multidisciplinary** — Same patterns work for code, documents, designs, and compliance artifacts
2. **Modularity** — Input skills are independent building blocks; use standalone or combine via aggregators
3. **Graceful Degradation** — Works with full automation, partial automation, or manual input
4. **Factual Voice** — No opinions. Observations start with `[DATA]` and include baseline comparisons
5. **Tool Agnostic** — Uses `~~` connector placeholders. Adapts to whatever tools your team runs
6. **Canonical Sources** — Checks against configured reference documents, not arbitrary search results

## Example Output

```markdown
# Sprint Retrospective Input | Sprint 14

**Sources:** manual input
**Baseline:** Sprints 11-13

---

### Cycle Time Improvement — success
[DATA] Avg cycle time decreased 14% to 31hr (vs 36hr baseline). Within <48hr norm.

### Throughput Drop — risk
[DATA] 8 stories completed (-20% vs 10-story baseline).

### Blocker Spike — improvement
[DATA] 7 blockers (+133% vs 3 baseline). 3 of 7 concentrated on LEGAL-12 (external counsel delays).
